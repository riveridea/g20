Problem-1: What are the minimum and maximum number os elements in a heap of height h?

-- maximum node is 2^(h+1)-1
   minimum node is 2^h - 1 + 1 = 2^h

Problem-6: Show that the height of a heap with n elements is logn?

--  A heap is a complete binary tree. All the levels, except the lowest, are completely full. A heap has at least 2^h element and at most 2^(h+1)-1. so 2^h <= n <= 2^(h+1)-1. This implies, h <= logn <= h+1. Since h is integer, h = logn.

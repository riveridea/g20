98. Validate Binary Search Tree:
https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary s
earch tree (BST).
Assume a BST is defined as follows:
1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less 
than the node's key.
2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater 
than the node's key.
3. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

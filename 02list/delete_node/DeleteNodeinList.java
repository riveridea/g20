Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in the middle
 of a ingly linked list, given only access to that node.

Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given 
the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 
1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

note: this problem cannot be solved if the node to be deleted 
is the last node in the linked list.

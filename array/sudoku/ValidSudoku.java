36. Valid Sudoku
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/

Determine if a Sudoku is valid, according to: Sudoku Puzzles - 
The Rules. Link: http://sudoku.com.au/TheRules.aspx

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are 
filled with the character '.'.

See Figure-1 : A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

Note:
A valid Sudoku board (partially filled) is not necessarily solvable. 
Only the filled cells need to be validated.

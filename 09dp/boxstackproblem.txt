# You have a stack of n boxes, with width W_i, height H_i, and depth D_i. The boxes
# cannot be rotated and can only be stacked on top of one another if each box in
# the stack is strictly larger than the box above it in width, height, and depth.
# Implement a method to build the tallest stack possible, where the height of a stack
# is the sum of the heights of each box.

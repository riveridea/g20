https://tonycao.gitbooks.io/leetcode-locked/content/LeetCode%20Locked/c1.5.html

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when 
rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down). Write a function to 
determine if a number is strobogrammatic. The number is represented 
as a string. For example, the numbers "69", "88", and "818" are 
all strobogrammatic.
